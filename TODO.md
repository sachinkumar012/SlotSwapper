- [x] Update CSS variables for improved color palette (better contrast, modern gradients)
- [x] Enhance hover and transition effects on request boxes and buttons
- [x] Add focus states for accessibility on buttons
- [x] Improve typography (font sizes, weights)
- [x] Adjust spacing and layout (margins, paddings, alignments)
- [x] Enhance responsiveness with additional media queries
- [x] Add subtle animations like fade-in for toasts or pulse for loading states
- [ ] Test the changes by running the frontend app
